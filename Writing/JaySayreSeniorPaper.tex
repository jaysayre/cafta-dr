I examine the impact of modern day trade liberalization on the wages of workers in the Dominican
Republic. The Central American Free Trade Agreement reduced nominal Dominican input tariffs
from an average of 12.06\% to 2.73\% from member countries, particularly the United States, over the
short period of 2006-2007. More pending.

Pending.

The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows; 
I introduce the context of CAFTA in Section \ref{sec:Context},
present the theory and relevant literature in Section \ref{sec:Litreview},
elaborate upon whether CAFTA-DR presents a natural experiment in Section \ref{sec:Exogeneity},
overview the construction of my data set in Section \ref{sec:Data}
and discuss implications of the model
in Section \ref{sec:Results}. Section \ref{sec:Conclusion} concludes.

\section{Context}
\label{sec:Context}
Over the last several decades, trade barriers have fallen substantially, and agreements promoting
free trade between countries have proliferated. The Central American Free Trade 
Agreement (CAFTA, or CAFTA-DR), aimed to lower trade barriers between Central American countries and 
the United States. One of the explicit aims of CAFTA was to reduce tariffs uniformly 
for United States imports into member Central American countries, and to "progressively eliminate customs duties on 
originating goods" \citep{ustraderep}.

In 2003, negotiations began on the Central American Free Trade Agreement, with Costa Rica, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the United States taking part in the discussions. The 
Dominican Republic joined the negotiations in early January, retitling the agreement the Dominican 
Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement. U.S. President George W. 
Bush signed CAFTA into law in 2005, but it took another two years for the 
Dominican Republic to fully implement the agreement, which it did on March 1, 2007.
Based upon World Trade Organization data,
I find CAFTA-DR reduced average Dominican 
Republic (D.R.) tariff rates on imports from member countries from 12.06\% to 2.73\% from 2006 to 
2007\footnote{Using a import-weighted average
of tariff rates for Harmonized System two-digit product codes, 
the unweighted average decrease is larger.}. The magnitude of this decrease on imported American
goods is similar to the size of the decrease in Mexican tariffs on American goods as a result of the
North American Free Trade Agreement \citep{goldberg}. 
In recent history, other countries such as Brazil reduced tariff barriers more drastically
\citep{kovak}; however, this is still economically meaningful, especially since the United States 
is the largest trading partner of the Dominican Republic, composing 
38.6 percent of  total imports into the D.R in 2013 \citep{wtocountry}\footnote{The 
United States also receives 56 percent of total exports from the Dominican Republic.}.

Tariffs on most products exported to the United States from Central America were 
already duty-free as part of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and so CAFTA largely 
removed ad-valorem taxes on American imports imposed by Carribean countries. 
The bill put a moratorium on establishing new tariff lines or raising customs 
duties between the parties involved, and explicitly defined a time table for each good to have its 
tariffs reduced. Of the goods that the Dominican Republic had formerly placed tariff barriers upon,
70.4\% of goods originating from the United States became duty free in 2007, another 6.5\%
of goods became duty free by 2012 (2013 being the year for which I have survey data for), with
the remaining 22.9\% of goods having partially reduced tariffs by 2013.
In summation, many goods were to be declared duty free initially upon implementation of the agreement, 
but many more were to have their duties phased out in a period of generally 5-10 years 
(see Appendix \ref{fig:Appendix1} for more information). Due to the structure of this agreement,
this allows me to examine the impact of reduced input tariff barriers on local 
Dominican import-competing producers, without largely having to consider the simultaneous 
changes in output tariffs.

%\section{Literature Review}
%\label{sec:Litreview}

\vspace{-10pt}
\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:Litreview}
There is a considerable existing literature discussing the link between trade openness
and changes in the wages of workers.
The canonical model of international trade, the Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model, 
predicts that a country abundant in a given factor will specialize 
in the production of goods that use that factor relatively intensively.
In the case of a developing country such as the Dominican Republic, the 
H-O model suggests that the country will specialize in the production of goods
which use unskilled labor relatively intensively in relation to capital. 
The connection to the income
distribution of a nation comes from the related Stolper-Samuelson Theorem,
which asserts that as a nation moves from autarky to free trade, the owners of the relatively
abundant factor, such as unskilled labor, will find their real incomes rising, while the owners of
the relatively scarce factor will find their real incomes falling. 
Therefore, upon lowering trade barriers, and thus increasing the price of unskilled labor intensive
good, unskilled workers may be expected to see their wages
increase.
However, this result is hard to empirically validate for two reasons. The Stolper-Samuelson Theorem
refers to economy-wide factor returns \citep{goldberg}, not the incomes of workers in a given intra-country
region, which is the focus of my study. Next, to my knowledge, there is little pre-existing data on the 
proportions of various factors in the Dominican Republic.

%on the role of intermediate inputs. Trade liberalization brings more
%access to foreign markets. Therefore domestic firms can import
%higher quality inputs, leading to higher productivity. There are
%other ways to improve productivity through the use of intermediate
%inputs. The love of variety approach, outlined in the Dixit-Stiglitz
%(1977) model, implies that the firm is more productive when using
%more varieties of intermediate inputs (Feenstra, Markusen and
%Zeile 1992, Acemoglu and Zilibotti 2001, Koren and Tenreyro 2007).
%Ethier (1982) attributes this effect as ”higher specialization in production”.
%In line with Ethier’s argument, I address the following
%question: How do import tariffs, in particular input tariffs and output
%tariffs, affect firms’ productivity through the import of intermediate
%inputs?ariff reductions
%in the intermediate and in the final market always have opposite
%effects on TFP. The reason is that trade liberalization changes the
%decision by firms to import intermediate inputs; and input and output
%tariffs, which are imposed in the intermediate and final market
%respectively, have opposite effects on the real marginal product of
%intermediate inputs.


One recent paper which explores the heterogenous impacts of trade upon domestic firms is \citet{holmes1},
which develops a model for how international trade affects domestic plants of varying sizes. 
Examining the effects of a surge in Chinese manufactured goods on U.S. manufacturers,
\citeauthor{holmes1} find that import competing plants that were large or produced standardized goods 
either closed down or laid off many of their workers, while smaller firms that produced specialized 
goods fared better, even \textit{within} a given industry classification. Further, the authors' 
model suggests that adverse wage impacts due to import competition should be more pronounced in 
areas where one industry is more concentrated. Although the data I have does not provide any 
indication of plants and their relative specialization, my firm level data allows one to infer 
how concentrated an industry/occupation is within a municipality. (I need to compute this as
an extension to what I have already done).

Another paper which introduces a model of trade liberalization and wages is \citet{amiti},
which finds heterogenous impacts of reduced trade barriers based upon the characteristics of
firms. Their model suggests that a decline in input tariffs raises the wages of workers at firms
using imported inputs, but reduces wages at firms that do not import inputs. 
\citeauthor{amiti} find that a 10\% point fall in input tariffs has an insignificant impact
on wages in firms that do not import but increases wages in firms that do import. 
To replicate these findings, it is necessary to obtain plant-level information on workers'
wages, and to determine the composition of inputs into the production process for each firm.
My data set, however, does not allow me link workers to their respective firms, and thus only
provides information regarding the average wages of workers in a given occupation. 

Finally, \citet{kovak}  examines 
the effect of trade liberalization on regional wage changes in Brazil. As a result of long standing
import substituting industrial policies, in 1987 the average tariff level in Brazil was high; 
54.9 percent. However, these were unsustainable, and by 1995, policymakers reduced average tariffs 
to 10.8 percent.
The author calculates, for each region, a measure for the share of regional production 
accounted for by each industry, and then for each of these industries estimates the effect tariff 
changes have had upon local wages in a region. 
To estimate these effects using reduced form equations relies upon the exogeneity of tariff changes to 
industry performance; that tariff changes have not been limited to only certain industries. 
The author argues that, in the context of Brazil, policy makers had explicit aims to cut tariffs 
uniformly, without prioritizing one industry over another, which is corroborated by showing that 
tariff cuts were largest in industries that had high barriers to trade initially.
Ultimately, \citeauthor{kovak} finds that a region facing 10 percentage point larger tariff-induced price 
decline experienced a 4.39 percentage point larger wage decline.

\section{Exogeneity of Tariff Decreases}
\label{sec:Exogeneity}
Before discussing the impact of tariff changes on labor markets in
the Dominican Republic, it is first necessary to comment upon the political economy of
tariff negotiations. \citet{grossman}, \citet{brock1978}, \citet{maggi2007political} and others, have observed the potential
for special interest lobbies within a country to have a significant impact upon policymakers
and their decisions, particularly when deciding which trade barriers to remove and which
to leave in place (or, in rarer cases, increase). One consequence of this is that tariff rates
and tariff rate reductions could be determined by endogenous factors; tariffs can be viewed as the
result of a political process, which would  obviously be intertwined with regional
labor markets. If this is the case, then estimates for the effect of tariffs on labor market
outcomes will suffer from omitted variable bias. Therefore, I discuss the qualitative and
quantitative evidence available on the potential exogeneity of the initial level of
trade barriers and tariff rate reductions as a result
of CAFTA. 

First, note that the level of Dominican trade protection in 2002 bears a large resemblance
to tariff barriers in place in 1996\footnote{Detailed
information on trade barriers is not available further back than this} (see Figure \ref{fig:Graph4}).
As many of the tariff barriers were set decades ago, it is less likely that their pre-CAFTA level 
was less reflective of forces attributed to the political economy of tariff rates, and 
more likely to be due to institutional constraints and
political difficulties in lowering tariffs without an intervention from another country (the
United States, in this case). 
Second, I compare the relationship between pre-CAFTA tariff
levels and the amount of tariff reduction in figures \ref{fig:Graph1}, \ref{fig:Graph2} and 
\ref{fig:Graph3}. If policymakers had the interest
in lowering tariffs uniformly, one would expect to see larger tariff reductions on products that
initially had higher protection levels. Indeed, for average tariffs on Harmonized System 
6 digit product codes (Figure \ref{fig:Graph1}), we see a fairly linear ($R^2=0.85$) relationship 
between the initial amount of protection for a good and
the amount of tariff decrease. These results suggest that Dominican tariff protection
was lowered more or less uniformly by CAFTA-DR.

Need to discuss qualitative evidence here, such as how policymakers
and D.R. President Leonel Fern\'{a}ndez stated that they did
not want to cater to special interests. Need to pull citation from 
\citet{guzman}, a key negotiator in the CAFTA process (I need to brush up on my high school Spanish).
Although each country negotiated tariff rate reductions individually with the
United States, as previously stated, the goal of the agreement was to lower tariffs on all
incoming goods. Fortunately, after the agreement was adopted and ratified, the United States
forbade the Dominican Congress from making any further modifications to the agreement, 
minimizing concerns of political influences \citep{usambassador}.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:Data}
Data for this project comes from combining several easily accessible databases, allowing
for straightforward replication of my results\footnote{Replication code for this paper is available
at \url{https://github.com/jaysayre/cafta-dr}}.
To measure the extent of trade liberalization, I estimate the level of trade barriers in the
Dominican Republic in 2002 and 2013. These years correspond with the years that household
survey data is available for the Dominican Republic. 
Between 2001 and 2006, Dominican Republic duties on American goods 
remained largely constant until the passage of CAFTA (Figure \ref{fig:Graph3}), so the 
difference in duties between 2002 and 2013 is primarily a result of the free trade agreement.
Furthermore, household survey results are available for July-October 2013; this implies
that the later portion of my panel dataset was collected than six years after CAFTA-DR was implemented 
in March 2007. In theory, this should hopefully be long enough for local labor markets to adjust 
to new changes in tariff barriers.

For tariff data in 2002, 
I use the \citet{wtotariff} Tariff Analysis database, which provides tariff nformation 
at the Harmonized System (HS) six digit level\footnote{The same source
also provides harmonized system two digit level information,
which I use for Figure \ref{fig:Graph3}}. To compute tariffs in 2013, 
I employ direct text from the CAFTA-DR bill, provided online by the 
\citet{ustraderep} at the HS eight digit level. The treaty provides
information on the base tariff rates of each eight digit good, and the tariff phase out
scheme for each good (Appendix \ref{fig:Appendix1}).
Using information on each phase out scheme, I calculate the estimated tariff
for each good in 2013. To combine these sources, I aggregate
the CAFTA-DR tariff information to the six digit level using an unweighted average, 
since, to my knowledge, trade volume statistics are not readily available at the HS eight digit level.
I then need to match up industrial products to their respective occupations to calculate
the estimated input tariff that a given occupation faces. 
To do this, I use a standard product to occupation concordance table\footnote{Found at 
\href{http://wits.worldbank.org/product_concordance.html}{World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS)}, 
provided by the World Bank.} to convert duties from the Harmonized System 6 digit level to the 
International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) four digit 
level\footnote{Specifically, a table from HS 1996 TO ISIC Rev. 3.1}.
For obvious reasons\footnote{For example, it is unclear what effect various inputs tariffs have
upon occupations in, say, the service sector.}, the concordance table matches product information
for only some of the occupation codes found in my survey data. Following the convention employed 
by the literature, I set the corresponding tariff faced by these occupations to zero.

For the survey data previously alluded to, I use two sources. 
Dominican Republic household survey data for 2002 comes from the 
Integrated Public Use Microdata Series International
(IPUMS) database, produced by the \citet{ipumsi} and conducted by the
\citet{one} (ONE). The IPUMS data provides information on 
survey respondents' income (measured as monthly total income in
2002 Dominican pesos), municipality of residence, and occupation,
provided at the ISIC two digit level, in addition to a host of other characteristics.
%More information on geographic displacement in appendix?
Household level data for 2013 comes from the 
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program, and is produced by \citet{dhs}.
Although the DHS dataset mostly provides information on the health 
characteristics of survey respondents, it also provides 
information on a respondent's occupation, place of residence,
and occupational income (provided in weekly 2013 Dominican pesos), in addition to other factors. 
DHS occupational information is provided without reference to any existing occupational/industrial 
classification system (as far as I am aware), so I convert it manually to
ISIC two digit codes (see Appendix \ref{fig:Appendix2}).
Although both sources provide weekly income data, I am primarily interested in data
on the average wage rate of workers in a given occupation, so I divide this data by the amount of
hours worked per week. %More information on this construction in appendix?

For my estimating equations at the municipal level,
I use several sources to estimate the share of economic activity in a given municipality.
Information on the number of firms by size (measured in terms of
number of workers employed) in a given industry at the 
municipality level in the Dominican Republic is provided by the 
Directory of Companies and Establishments (Directorio de Empresas y Establecimientos)
provided by 
%the \citet{one} 
ONE for 2010\footnote{Available online at \href{http://www.one.gov.do/recursos-automatizados/
323/directorio-de-empresas-y-establecimientos/}{ONE}. Note: this page, in my experience,
only works sporadically.}. This information is provided
at the International Standard Industrial Classification four digit level, which I sum
up to the ISIC two digit level by municipality and number of workers employed.
I then combine this plant level data with IPUMS survey data from 2002 and 2010 to provide 
clearer estimates of the number of workers employed in each industry. Recalling that occupational data
for IPUMS is provided at the ISIC two digit level, I use this to compute the estimated
share of industrial activity per municipality for both 2002 and 2010.
% More details here
Next, I merge each ISIC occupation code with the four digit ISIC duties computed above, 
and then estimate the average level of tariff in a municipality using a weighted average
based upon the estimated number of workers in a given occupation in that 
municipality\footnote{i.e. Average Tariff$_m = \bar{t}_m =
\dfrac{\displaystyle \sum_{\text{All occupations}_m} |workers_{o,m}| \cdot t_o}
{\displaystyle \sum_{\text{All occupations}_m} |workers_{o,m}|}$, where $o$ is the 
occupation, $m$ is a municipality, and $t$ is the tariff rate}. Finally, I aggregate
the wage rate for workers listed as currently employed by the private sector who 
have occupations for in the 2013 DHS 
and 2002 IPUMS survey data to the municipality level and merge
this to the average tariff data. 
To accurately compare changes in wages, I convert 2002 
and 2013 Dominican monthly wages in pesos to 2013 US Dollars using the nominal exchange rate.

Next, for my estimating equations at the occupational 
and municipal level, I aggregate the wage rate for workers listed as currently employed 
by the private sector in the the 2013 DHS and 2002 IPUMS survey data to the 
municipal and occupational (ISIC two digit) level, and as above, 
convert this income data to 2013 United States Dollars. 
This is then merged with the ISIC tariff data, which I aggregate to the ISIC two digit level using
an unweighted average. 

\vspace{-10pt}
\section{Estimation Strategy}
\label{sec:Model}
%My model is adapted from the model presented in \citep{amiti}.

%First, consumers consume final goods as presented by Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) % need this citation. 
%Each consumers' expenditure minimization problem (EMP) is
%given by $\displaystyle \min E = \int_{v \in \mathcal{V}} p(v)q(v)dv$ such that 
%$\displaystyle \left[\int_{v \in \mathcal{V}} q(v)^{(\sigma-1)/\sigma} dv \right]^{\sigma/(\sigma-1)} 
%= U$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of all final good varieties, and $\sigma > 1$ is the elasticity 
%of substitution between varieties. This yields a demand curve for product $v$ given by 
%$q(v)=\left[\dfrac{p(v)}{P}\right]^{-\sigma}Q$ and total revenue for a product given by
%$r(v)=R[\dfrac{p(v)}{P}]^{1-\sigma}$, where $Q:= U$, and $P$ is an aggregate price index given by
%$\displaystyle P = \left[\int_{v \in \mathcal{V}} p(v)^{1-\sigma} dv \right]^{\frac{1}{1-\sigma}}$, 
%with $PQ=R$.

% Perhaps I have no model with a really good literature review?

\vspace{-10pt}
\section{Results}
\label{sec:Results}
%I adopt an estimation strategy similar to that of \citeauthor{kovak} and \citeauthor{amiti}. 
%In particular, if I can make the case that tariff changes due to CAFTA are arguably exogenous to 
%local labor markets in the
%Dominican Republic, then a reduced form approach will be an appropriate method to examine
%the changes in wages due trade liberalization. Therefore, I make this case in Section 
%\ref{sec:Exogeneity}.


The theoretical 


My estimating equation should is 
\begin{equation}
\ln(w_{2013})- \ln(w_{2002}) = \beta_0 \iota + \beta_1( \bar{t}_{2013,m}-\bar{t}_{2002,m})+
+Z_p \Gamma + \epsilon_m
\end{equation}




At the municipality level, my estimating equation is 
\begin{equation}
\Delta w_m = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \Delta t_m + \epsilon_m 
\end{equation}
$\text{~where~}
\Delta w_m := \bar{w}_{2013,m} - \bar{w}_{2002,m} \text{~and~} \Delta t_m := 
\left|\bar{t}_{2013,m}-\bar{t}_{2002,m} \right|$\footnote{This is equivalent
since all tariffs in 2002 were higher than those than 2013.}$= \bar{t}_{2002,m}-\bar{t}_{2013,m}$.
Above, $m$ stands for municipality, and average tariffs in a municipality, $\bar{t}_{y,m}$, 
are constructed as described in the data section, $\beta_1$ is my coefficient of interest,
and $\epsilon_m$ are my disturbances.
I also add province fixed effects (where province is one adminstrative level
above the municipality level in the Dominican Republic) to some of my equations, 
although there should be no theoretical reason to do this. 
Figure \ref{fig:Table1} displays the results of this estimation.

Ultimately, I find that a one-unit decrease in the average tariff rate in a municipality
is associated with a 108 dollar decrease in incomes within that municipality, a 
statistically significant result. Including province fixed effects neither changes the 
sign or relative magnitude of this estimate, although it becomes no longer statistically
significant (although fairly close to being statistically significant).

Next, at the municipality and occupational level, my estimating equations take the form
\begin{equation}
\Delta w_{m,o} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \Delta t_o + \nu_{m,o},
\end{equation}
$\text{~where~}
\Delta w_{m,o} := \bar{w}_{2013,m,o} - \bar{w}_{2002,m,o} \text{~and~} 
\Delta t_o := t_{2002,o}-t_{2013,o}$.
Note that here, tariffs ($t$) are at the ISIC two digit occupational level, and wages 
have instead been aggregated to each occupation ($o$) for which there is
corresponding tariff information within a municipality. As before, $\gamma_1$ is
my coefficient of interest and $\nu_{m,o}$ are my error terms.
I also include municipality level fixed effects to some of my equations, but
as before, this only serves to provide ``clearer'' coefficient estimates.
Figure \ref{fig:Table2} displays the results of this estimation.

Examining the results of these estimations, I find that a one unit 
decrease in the tariff rate is associated with a 330 dollar increase 
in average occupational income in a municipality, a result which is
highly statistically significant. Adding municipal
fixed effects does little to change this estimate, as expected.
Adding an additional covariate, change in employment, estimated
using IPUMS occupation data for 2002 and 2013, similarly does
little to effect my main coefficient of interest.
